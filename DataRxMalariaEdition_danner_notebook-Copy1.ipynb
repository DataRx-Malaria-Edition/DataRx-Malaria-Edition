    "\n",
    "- **Peptides:** Peptides are short chains of amino acids that are the building blocks of proteins.\n",
    "- **Previous amino acid:** The \"previous amino acid\" refers to the amino acid that comes before a specific amino acid in a peptide sequence.\n",
    "- **K or R:** These are specific amino acids.\n",
    "- **K:** K stands for lysine\n",
    "- **R:** R stands for arginine\n",
    "- **SPP:** Stands for `Plasmodium proteins signal peptide peptidase` - is an enzyme found in malaria-causing parasites called Plasmodium. Its job is to remove specific \"signal peptides\" from newly made proteins as they are being processed inside the parasite's cells.\n",
    "- **NAT:** stands for `N-acetyltransferase` - N-acetyltransferase (NAT) is an enzyme that helps modify different substances inside living organisms. It transfers a small molecule called an acetyl group to other molecules, changing their properties... NATs are involved in a wide range of biological processes, including the metabolism of drugs, toxins, and endogenous compounds in organisms. They play a role in detoxification by modifying and facilitating the elimination of certain substances from the body.\n",
    "- **Signal Peptides:** Signal peptides are like addresses that guide the proteins to the right place within the parasite's cells. Once the proteins reach their destination, SPP cuts off these signal peptides, allowing the proteins to function properly.\n",
    "- **Research question 4:** In what peptides does the previous amino acid not = K or R... does this differ between SPP vs. NAT?"

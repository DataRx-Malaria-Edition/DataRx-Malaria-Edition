## Overview

In their research working to find a cure for Malaria, researchers at Washington University have collected data from two medical trails. These researches need assistance in applying data science tools to analyze their research data. They are "looking at what proteins are associated with _Plasmodium_ proteins signal peptide peptidase (SPP) and N-acetyltransferase (NAT). For analysis, the team should be normalizing to the total protein spectra in each sample".

## Feature Tasks And Objectives

This project will utilize Python's data science libraries (e.g, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.) to explore and analyze the data from the two trials, and attempt to answer the following questions:

- [ ] What proteins are enriched in SPP vs. NAT?
- [ ] Do protein modifications differ between SPP vs. NAT?
- [ ] Are specific pathways/GO terms enriched in SPP vs. NAT?
- [ ] In what peptides does the previous amino acid not = K or R... does this differ between SPP vs. NAT?
- [ ] Are transmembrane domains enriched in the SPP vs. NAT peptides?

## Vision

- What is the vision of this product?
    - To help find and narrow down what could lead to a cure for malaria, including different ways to deliver medications.

- What pain point does this project solve?
    - A team of malaria researchers who pulled down all this data and they don't know how to analyze this. They want our help.

- Why should we care about your product?
    - Over 1,300 children die per day of malaria. This is a major issue.
